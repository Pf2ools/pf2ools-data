		"Minor Boon": [
			"Ralef slips you free from your bonds. Once, when you fail a save against an effect that would make you {@condition grabbed}, {@condition immobilized}, or {@condition restrained}, you critically succeed instead. Ralef typically grants this boon only if you are hopeless to survive the threat."
		],
		"Minor Curse": [
			"Bolts spontaneously jam, keys don't seem to fit, and mechanisms seize up. You have a \u22123 status penalty to {@action Pick an Lock}, and, whenever you try to open or unlock a door, lock, or container, or you cast the {@spell knock} spell, make a DC {@flatDC 6} flat check. On a failure, your action fails and is wasted."
		],
		"Major Curse": [
			"Ralef places a recurring curse to humble you. Each midnight, make a DC {@flatDC 6} flat check. On a failure, you must succeed on a DC 40 Fortitude save or be transformed into a harmless, {@trait Tiny} fish for 24 hours. Your mind is unchanged, although there is very little you can do in this form. This is a {@trait polymorph} effect. If you die while transformed, the transformation is permanent.",
			"Ralef will typically delay your first transformation until you are close enough to some water\u2014whether a river or a bucket\u2014to survive at least one day in your new form."
