			"Lacking recourse, Ram'jara makes you a prisoner of your own body. Over the course of one week, your body below the jaw becomes progressively stiffer until they no longer move at all. You have a \u22124 status penalty to AC, {@skill Perception}, and Reflex saves, and you are permanently {@condition flat-footed}. You can't act in any way that requires movement from something other than your face or voice."
