		"Minor Boon": [
			"Once, when you roll a failure on a {@skill Deception} or {@skill Stealth} check to protect an uprising from discovery, you critically succeed instead. Milani typically grants this boon for extremely significant checks on which the uprising's survival hinges."
		],
		"Moderate Boon": [
			"When you use it to protect others, your shield blooms with roses brimming with razor-sharp thorns. You gain the {@feat Shield Warden} feat, even if you don't meet its prerequisites. If you already had that feat, if your shield takes damage from a melee {@action Strike} in defense of your ally, the attacker takes piercing damage equal to half the shield's Hardness."
		],
		"Major Boon": [
			"You gain +4 status bonus to checks to {@action Request} during attempts to satisfy one of Milani's edicts. Once per day, you can sound a battle cry that grants creatures within a 30-foot emanation the effects of {@spell freedom of movement} and affects all doors, locks, containers, and other bindings used to restrain or imprison others with the effects of the {@spell knock} spell."
		],
		"Minor Curse": [
			"A magical wreath of thorny, blood-red roses endlessly grows from your scalp, no matter how much you try to remove it. You gain weakness 5 to piercing damage."
		],
		"Moderate Curse": [
			"Ropes, chains, manacles, and other equipment used to bind or constrain become blazing hot in your hands, bursting into flame or melting as if engulfed in a forge. When you attempt to hold such an item, you take {@damage 2d6} fire damage and the item is destroyed."
		],
		"Major Curse": [
			"Small wounds bleed more than seems physically possible. Whenever you take slashing or piercing damage, you also take {@condition persistent damage||persistent bleed damage} equal to the level of the creature or effect that inflicted the damage."
