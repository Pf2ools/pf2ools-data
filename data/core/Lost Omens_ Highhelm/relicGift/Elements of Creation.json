			"When you activate creative spark, you can choose to summon an {@creature air wisp|B3}, a {@creature water wisp|B3}, and an {@creature earth wisp|B3} in unoccupied squares next to you, in addition to the {@creature fire wisp|B3}. Unlike a typical {@creature earth wisp|B3}, the summoned {@creature earth wisp|B3} takes the form of a small iron creature resembling an anvil crossed with a horned beetle. Like the {@creature fire wisp|B3}, these additional wisps don't act in combat but can assist you while you {@action Craft} items. While all four wisps are assisting you, the bonus you gain from {@relicGift creative spark|LOHh} is doubled, and your outcome for {@skill Crafting} checks related to blacksmithing is one degree of success better than your roll. In addition, being assisted by all four wisps replaces the need for any equipment other than blacksmithing tools when crafting metal items. The wisps last for up to 10 minutes or until you {@action Dismiss} them all together as an action. If you extend the duration of the {@creature fire wisp|B3}, it also extends the duration for the other wisps."
