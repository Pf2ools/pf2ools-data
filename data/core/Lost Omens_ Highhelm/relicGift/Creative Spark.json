					"You strike the relic against a piece of flint and summon a {@creature fire wisp|B3}to assist you, which appears in an unoccupied square next to you. The {@creature fire wisp|B3} doesnâ€™t act in combat, but it can assist you while you {@action Craft} items. You gain a +1 bonus to {@skill Crafting} checks involving blacksmithing and general metalworking, increasing to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 17th level. Once per day, when you roll a critical failure on a {@skill Crafting} check related to blacksmithing, you get a failure instead. The wisp replaces the need for a forge while blacksmithing, but you still require other equipment and tools. The wisp remains for up to 10 minutes or until you {@action Dismiss} it. You can extend this duration by an additional 10 minutes if you feed the wisp one light Bulk worth of charcoal or firewood, or one pint of oil."
