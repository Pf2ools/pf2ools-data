You might have been raised in this ideology, gleaned it from superstition, or received a prophetic vision. Regardless, you've come to view the stars and whatever power they evoke as a path to doom, a curse to warn the masses. Others might spurn your warnings, while some might join you in enlightening the ignorant. To you, there's no greater truth than the coming end, and you know that whatever the cause for it will come from the stars\u2014or perhaps the stars are just a gate to a more terrifying beyond.",
