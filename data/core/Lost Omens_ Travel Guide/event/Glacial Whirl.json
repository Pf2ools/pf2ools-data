You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to {@skill Perception} checks and Will saves against {@trait illusion} effects. When you come within 10 feet of an illusion that can be disbelieved, the GM rolls a secret check for you to disbelieve it, even if you didn't spend an action to {@action Interact} with the illusion. The lights fade from your eyes after 1 month.",

					"Failure": "Your eyes can't keep up with the rapid movement. You concentrate too hard, and a bright afterimage of the dancers burns across your vision, causing you to become {@condition dazzled} for 1 week.",
					"Critical Failure": "The reflection of the sun off a glacier catches you directly in the eyes as you move around. You become permanently {@condition blinded}."
