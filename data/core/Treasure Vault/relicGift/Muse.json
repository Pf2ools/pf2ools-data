			"The relic guides you in your art like a muse, giving you inspirational ideas and providing an item bonus to {@skill Crafting} or {@skill Performance} checks. (Choose one. If your relic allows you to do so, you can take this gift again to choose the other.) If the relic is 3rd level or higher, you gain a +1 item bonus. Once the relic attains 9th level, the bonus increases to +2. The bonus increases to +3 when the relic is 17th level."
