You're trained in the skill just long enough to make that single check (to a maximum of 10 minutes). Whether or not the check succeeds, in the next 24 hours you must perform a minor favor to appease the spirit who aided you, determined by the GM (usually something sensation related, such as tasting a certain food, listening to a specific song, or smoking a pipe). You can't Host Spirit again until you've performed the favor. If you haven't completed it after 24 hours, you're {@condition fatigued} until the obligation is fulfilled."
