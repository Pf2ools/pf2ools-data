			"You were given a second opportunity at life by mysterious forces in the Lands of Second Souls. You remember your life before your death and now live with an extra lifetime of knowledge.",

			"You become trained in two {@skill Lore} skills, which you and your GM choose from {@skill Lore} skills associated with your past life. At 3rd level, 7th level, and 15th level, you receive skill increases, which you can apply only to these {@skill Lore} skills. In certain situations analogous to your past life, fragments of memories resurface, potentially helping or distracting you. The GM can offer you a +1 circumstance bonus on skill checks with either of these {@skill Lore} skills or on other skill checks that echo your past life. If you accept but fail the check, you're {@condition stupefied||stupefied 1} for 1 minute by the mental distraction of your past-life memories, or {@condition stupefied||stupefied 2} for 1 minute on a critical failure."
