Despite being a {@trait minion}, your familiar gains 1 reaction at the start of its turns, which it can use only to {@action Aid} you on a {@action Recall Knowledge} skill check for a skill in which it has the {@familiarAbility skilled|APG} familiar ability (it still has to prepare to help you as normal for the {@action Aid} reaction). It automatically succeeds at its check to {@action Aid} you with those skills or automatically critically succeeds if you're a master of the skill in question. Your familiar must have the {@familiarAbility skilled|APG} ability to select this."
