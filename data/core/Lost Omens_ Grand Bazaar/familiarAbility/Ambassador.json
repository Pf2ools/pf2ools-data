			"Your familiar knows how to act cute or focused on cue, helping you make a good impression. Despite being a minion, your familiar gains 1 reaction at the start of its turns, which it can use only to {@action Aid} you on a {@skill Diplomacy} check to {@action Make an Impression} (it still has to prepare to help you as normal for the Aid reaction, which requires it to participate throughout the activity). It automatically succeeds at its check to {@action Aid} you with those skills or automatically critically succeeds if you're a master of the skill in question."
