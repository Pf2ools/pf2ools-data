			"Perhaps you joined the group out of a sense of duty to your fellow Absalomians, or maybe you felt an obligation to help restore your apocalyptic home district to some semblance of normalcy. Either way, the traumas you've endured, the double-crossers who've betrayed you, the wretched monsters that have crawled out of the muck to assail you\u2014it's enough to turn an officer to weary cynicism or self-destruction through merciful drink.",

			"You're trained in the {@skill Survival} skill, as well as either {@skill Lore||Labor Lore} or {@skill Lore||Underworld Lore}. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to {@skill Deception}, {@skill Diplomacy}, and {@skill Intimidation} checks to interact with Muckruckers, mercenaries, and adventurers. You gain the {@feat Experienced Tracker} skill feat."
