You've seen more acts than you can count and grew up hearing the tall tales of circus performers while gathered around their campfires. You've experienced the thrill of captivating a crowd ever since you were young. You may have tried a few times to settle down, but the lure of the open road and the glamor of the big top always called you back.",
