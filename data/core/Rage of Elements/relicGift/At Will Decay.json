An enemy that starts its turn in the cloud takes 15 slashing damage with a basic Fortitude save. If the target has the {@trait metal} trait or is primarily made of metal, the damage is 30 instead. Unattended non-{@trait magical} {@trait metal} items within the cloud automatically become {@condition broken}."
