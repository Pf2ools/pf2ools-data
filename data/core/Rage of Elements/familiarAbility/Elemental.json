			"Your familiar has the {@trait elemental} trait instead of the {@trait animal} trait. Choose {@trait air}, {@trait earth}, {@trait fire}, {@trait metal}, {@trait water}, or {@trait wood}. Your familiar gains that trait. The familiar is immune to {@trait bleed}, {@trait paralyzed}, {@trait poison}, {@trait sleep}, and the element matching its trait. Your familiar must have the resistance familiar ability to select this, unless it's a specific familiar. You can't select this ability if your familiar has a trait other than {@trait animal} (such as a leshy familiar or an undead familiar)."
