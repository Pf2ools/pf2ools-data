			"Using magnetism, magic, or other forces, your familiar can float up to 3 feet above solid and liquid surfaces while moving at a Speed of 25 feet. This allows it to ignore difficult terrain and damaging effects related to coming into direct contact with the surface. It typically allows the familiar to also avoid triggering the reactions of hazards that require you to step on them or an attached pressure plate."
