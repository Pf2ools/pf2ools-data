			"An eye for detail, a sense for the wind, and a strong trust in your gut feelings. These qualities have set you apart from others when it comes to assisting a sharpshooter with setting up the perfect shot against their target. Elevation, velocity, and concealmentâ€”these are all vital factors that need to be considered to pull off a feat of true marksmanship, and no sniper would be able to function without an experienced spotter. Since your younger days, you've put your skills as a spotter to work as an adventurer. Whether you're taking your own shots now or spotting for others, your talents grant you an edge in an adventuring career.",
