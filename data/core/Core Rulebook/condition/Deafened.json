You take a \u20132 status penalty to {@skill Perception} checks for initiative and checks that involve sound but also rely on other senses. If you perform an action with the {@trait auditory} trait, you must succeed at a DC {@flatDC 5} flat check or the action is lost; attempt the check after spending the action but before any effects are applied. You are immune to {@trait auditory} effects."
