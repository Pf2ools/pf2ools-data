			"This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose these conditions on player characters. A creature that is friendly to a character likes that character. The character can attempt to make a {@action Request} of a friendly creature, and the friendly creature is likely to agree to a simple and safe request that doesn't cost it much to fulfill. If the character or one of their allies uses hostile actions against the creature, the creature gains a worse attitude condition depending on the severity of the hostile action, as determined by the GM."
