			"You're distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a \u20132 circumstance penalty to AC. Some effects give you the {@condition flat-footed} condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others\u2014especially conditions\u2014can make you universally flatfooted against everything. If a rule doesn't specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say \"The target is {@condition flat-footed}."
