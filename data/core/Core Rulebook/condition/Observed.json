			"Anything in plain view is observed by you. If a creature takes measures to avoid detection, such as by using {@skill Stealth} to {@action Hide}, it can become {@condition hidden} or {@condition undetected} instead of observed. If you have another precise sense instead of or in addition to sight, you might be able to observe a creature or object using that sense instead. You can observe a creature only with precise senses. When {@action Seeking} a creature using only imprecise senses, it remains {@condition hidden}, rather than observed."
