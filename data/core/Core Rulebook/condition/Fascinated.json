			"You are compelled to focus your attention on something, distracting you from whatever else is going on around you. You take a â€“2 status penalty to {@skill Perception} and skill checks, and you can't use actions with the {@trait concentrate} unless they or their intended consequences are related to the subject of your fascination (as determined by the GM). For instance, you might be able to {@action Seek} and {@action Recall Knowledge} about the subject, but you likely couldn't cast a spell targeting a different creature. This condition ends if a creature uses hostile actions against you or any of your allies."
