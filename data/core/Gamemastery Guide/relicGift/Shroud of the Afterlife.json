While this shroud is active, you take on a pallid appearance and gain poison resistance equal to half the relic's level and a +1 status bonus to saving throws against death effects, diseases, effects that would make you {@condition paralyzed}, {@trait poison}, and {@trait sleep} effects. In addition, the DC for your recovery checks is 9 + your dying value instead of 10 + your dying value."
