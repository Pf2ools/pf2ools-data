			"Water collects at the tip of your relic. You can adjust your grip on your relic with an {@action Interact} action to allow you to make lashing current weapon {@action strike||Strikes} with your relic, which deal {@damage 1d4} bludgeoning damage; have the {@trait disarm}, {@trait finesse}, {@trait reach <10>}, {@trait trip}, and {@trait versatile <S>} traits; and are in the {@group flail} group. Your lashing current {@action strike||Strikes} gain the benefit of your relic's fundamental and property runes, though any property runes that would not be applicable to the lashing currents are not applied. You can use another {@action Interact} action to return to your normal grip and make {@action strike||Strikes} with the relic."
