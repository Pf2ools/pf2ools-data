					"You can call upon the terrifying powers that fuel your relic to transform yourself into a specter of death. You become {@trait incorporeal}, having no physical body. You are immune to effects that require a physical body, including precision damage as well as exposure to most diseases and poisons. You also have resistance to all damage equal to half the relic's level; force damage, {@item ghost touch} attacks, negative damage, and positive damage ignore this resistance, and the resistance doubles against non-magical damage.",
					"You can move through solid objects. When inside an object, you can't perceive, attack, or {@action Interact} with anything outside it, and you're always {@condition slowed 1} on turns you start in an object. Corporeal creatures can pass through you but can't end their movement in your space. You can't attempt Strength-based checks against corporeal creatures or objects, unless those objects have the {@item ghost touch} property rune. Likewise, corporeal creatures can't attempt Strength-based checks against you.",
					"You can {@action sustain an activation||Sustain the Activation} up to 1 minute."
