			"Your relic's energies have given you control over the boundary between flesh and stone. You can cast 6th-level {@spell flesh to stone} and {@spell stone to flesh} as innate spells, each once per day. As long as you are standing on the earth, your body reflexively petrifies at the moment you are struck, granting you resistance 5 to physical damage (except {@item adamantine (generic)||adamantine}). This increases to 8 in caves or subterranean environments."
