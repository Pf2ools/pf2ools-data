			"You stand on the threshold between the living and the dead. If you attempt a saving throw against an effect that would deal negative damage to you, such as {@spell harm}, your outcome is one degree of success better than what you rolled. If you roll a critical success and the effect is capable of healing undead, you regain HP equal to half the spell's full damage. Any {@trait positive} spell or effect that would heal you has only half the normal effect. All these effects apply only if you are a living creature."
