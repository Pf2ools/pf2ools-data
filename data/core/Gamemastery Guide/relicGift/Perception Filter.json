If it rolls a {@skill Perception} check to {@action Seek} or otherwise detect you, it gets the outcome one degree of success worse than what it rolled, and if you roll a {@skill Stealth} check to {@action Hide}, {@action Sneak}, or otherwise escape its attention, you get the outcome one degree of success better than what you rolled against the creature.
