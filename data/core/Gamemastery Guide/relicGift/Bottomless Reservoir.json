You either touch your relic to an adjacent body of water and absorb 1 gallon of it into the reservoir, or you release 1 gallon of a liquid from the reservoir. You can add another action to the activation to absorb water from a touched creature made entirely of water, like a water elemental. If you do, it takes {@damage 1d6} damage per relic level (basic Fortitude save)."
