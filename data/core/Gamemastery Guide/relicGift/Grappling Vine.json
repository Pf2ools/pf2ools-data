					"Your relic launches a sticky, multi-stranded vine at a target within 50 feet. Make an attack roll as you would when using a {@item grappling hook}, but if you roll a critical failure on the check to secure the vine, you get a failure instead. Once the vine is anchored, creatures receive a +1 status bonus to {@skill Athletics} checks to {@action Climb} the vine, and they gain a +5-foot status bonus to the distance they move with a successful check while {@action climb||Climbing} using the vine.",
					"The vine lasts for 1 day or until you use Grappling Vine again, at which point your older vine withers."
