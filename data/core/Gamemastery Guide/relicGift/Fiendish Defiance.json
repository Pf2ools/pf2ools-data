			"The fiendish power of your relic offers you more protection against {@trait celestial||celestials} and allows you to ignore harm. While wearing the relic, you gain a +1 status bonus to AC against attacks by {@trait celestial||celestials} and resistance to an energy type corresponding to the relic's fiendish origin (such as fire resistance from a {@trait devil}). The resistance is equal to half the relic's level (minimum 1)."
