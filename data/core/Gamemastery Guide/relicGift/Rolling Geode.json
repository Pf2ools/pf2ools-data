					"Stone and crystal form a sphere that chases your foes. You create a geode in an unoccupied square within 30 feet. You can spend a single action, which has the {@trait concentrate} trait, to move the geode up to 30 feet along the ground. If the geode enters a creature's space, the creature must succeed at a basic Reflex save or take {@damage 2d6} bludgeoning damage; a creature can take damage this way only once per turn, even if you roll the geode through its space multiple times. The geode persists for up to 1 minute or until destroyed or {@action dismiss||Dismissed}; it has AC 5, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points, and is immune to critical hits and precision damage."
