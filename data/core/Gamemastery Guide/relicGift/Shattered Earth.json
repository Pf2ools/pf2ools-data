					"Seismic pulses from your relic ripple through the nearby ground, shaking sharp fragments to the surface. A 10-foot-radius patch of stone or earth within 60 feet is transformed into difficult terrain. A creature that enters an affected square during a move action must succeed at an {@skill Acrobatics} check or Reflex save or take {@damage 1d6} piercing damage; it needs to roll only once per {@trait move} action even if it moves through several squares. At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, increase the damage by {@damage 1d6}."
