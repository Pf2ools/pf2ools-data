			"Your relic awakens to sapience, developing a personality (usually one that clashes with your own). Your relic has an alignment corresponding to the type of {@trait fiend} associated with the item, precise vision and imprecise hearing each out to 30 feet, the ability to understand and speak one language you know, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma modifiers of {@d20 +0}. Your item's total {@skill Perception} and Will modifiers are equal to your proficiency modifiers in {@skill Perception} and Will, respectively. It is trained in the {@skill Lore} associated with its {@trait fiend} type (such as {@skill lore||Demon Lore}), for a total modifier of 2 + the relic's level. Unlike most {@trait intelligent} items, the relic has no actions or reactions and can't use any of its own activations."
