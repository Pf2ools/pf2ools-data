			"Your relic grows potent natural medicines. Each night, two medicinal herbs (or other plants) grow from your relic and can be harmlessly harvested during your next daily preparations. A living creature that consumes an herb with an {@action Interact} action regains {@damage 1d8} Hit Points for every 2 relic levels (minimum {@damage 1d8}). At 9th level, the relic grows three herbs each night, and at 17th level, the relic grows four herbs each night. Herbs wither away 1 day after being harvested."
