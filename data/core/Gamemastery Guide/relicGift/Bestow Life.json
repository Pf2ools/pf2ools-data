					"An infusion of positive energy from your relic can temporarily animate an unliving object. You transform an adjacent inanimate object into an animated object with a level equal to one-half the relic's level and appropriate to the object (so a broom would become an {@creature animated broom}). The object pursues a single simple noncombat task you state when you use Bestow Life, ignoring any subsequent commands. The object is mindless and pursues the task single-mindedly and uncreatively. The object remains animated for 1 hour."
