					"Your stare causes a creature's flesh to rot and wither away. Target a creature you can see within 30 feet. Your stare deals {@damage 1d6} negative damage to the creature for every 2 levels the relic has (minimum {@damage 1d6}; basic Fortitude save). An {@trait undead} creature or other creature with {@ability negative healing|b2} targeted this way is instead healed {@damage 1d6} HP per level of the relic and is temporarily immune to this effect for 10 minutes."
