Typically, you still decide how it spends that action, but, the GM might determine that your familiar chooses its own tactics rather than performing your preferred action. This doesn't work with {@familiarAbility valet|APG} or similar abilities that require a command, if you're capable of riding your familiar, or similar situations."
