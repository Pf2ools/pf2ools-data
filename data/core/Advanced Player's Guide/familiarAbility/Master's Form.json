			"Your familiar can change shape as a single action, transforming into a humanoid of your ancestry with the same age, gender, and build of its true form, though it always maintains a clearly unnatural remnant of its nature, such as a cat's eyes or a serpent's tongue. This form is always the same each time it uses this ability. This otherwise uses the effects of {@spell humanoid form}, except the change is purely cosmetic. It only appears humanoid and gains no new capabilities. Your familiar must have the {@familiarAbility manual dexterity} and {@familiarAbility speech} abilities to select this."
