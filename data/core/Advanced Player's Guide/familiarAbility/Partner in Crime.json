Despite being a minion, your familiar gains 1 reaction at the start of its turns, which it can use only to {@action Aid} you on a {@skill Deception} or {@skill Thievery} skill check (it still has to prepare to help you as normal for the {@action Aid} reaction). It automatically succeeds at its check to {@action Aid} you with those skills or automatically critically succeeds if you're a master of the skill in question."
