You soon discovered that you could will your very bones into extending from your flesh like thorns from a rose's stem. Though you didn't choose the title gatewalker for yourself, you're sure you can use your strange new power to exercise control over your life.",
			"Your deviant abilities are of the troll classification. You gain the {@feat Bone Spikes|DA} deviant feat. As a quirk, whenever you use a deviant ability, the very fibers of your muscles flex and expand to impossible proportions. Your actual strength remains the same during these times, but few can deny your fearsome appearance.",
