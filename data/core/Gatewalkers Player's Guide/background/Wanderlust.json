			"You've traveled the world for years in search of excitement and adventure. On the night of the Missing Moment, all the many exciting occasions you've experienced paled in comparison to the vision of fantastic lands and incredible people you saw on the other side of the glowing gate.",
			"You stepped through in the hopes of finally reaching the thrilling highs you so desperately seek, but as soon as you'd gone there you were again, standing in front of a lightless gateway with a months-long gap in your memories. Frustrated at having come so close to achieving your dreams, you swung at a nearby tree, smashing it to splinters with surprising strength you never knew you had.",
			"This strange new brawn wasn't what you asked forâ€”but it might help you pursue the excitement you crave.",
			"Your deviant abilities are of the troll classification. You gain the {@feat Titan Swing|DA} deviant feat. As a quirk, whenever you use a deviant ability, your feet elongate and your leg bones crack as your lower limbs transform into those of a rabbit, wolf, or other spry, long-heeled animal.",
			"Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.",
			"You're trained in the {@skill Nature} skill and the {@skill Lore||Stabling Lore} skill. You gain the {@feat Express Rider|APG} skill feat."
