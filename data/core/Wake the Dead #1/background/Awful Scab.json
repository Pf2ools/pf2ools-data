			"Prior to the Evisceration of 4707, the district of V'drysha was a lovely borough on the southern edge of Ecanus. Now, it's the Awful, a vast morass of spell-resistant flesh and sinew, ever threatening to engulf the city. You were once a Scab working to push back its infuence. It's a nasty, dangerous job, and poorly paid as well, but at least you learned enough to mimic a viscerasuit, the enchanted, airtight suit that protected you from the poisons and plagues of the Awful.",
			"Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.",
			"You're trained in {@skill Medicine} and {@skill Lore||Fleshforged Lore}. You also know how to seal your clothing or armor like a viscerasuit. During your daily preparations, you can seal your outft. The frst time each day you are introduced to {@trait poison} or {@trait disease} without taking physical damage, the sealed outft attempts to counteract it using your {@skill Medicine} modifer as the counteract modifer."
