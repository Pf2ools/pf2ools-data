# Changelog

Pf2ools gets better all the time!

This changelog documents only _major changes_ to the repository, such as newly converted content, extra developer features, schema changes, and anything else we deem significant enough. You can assume that typos and tagging improvements have occurred with every release!

## (Unreleased)
