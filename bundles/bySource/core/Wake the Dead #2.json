					"The living residents of Geb are known as the quick, and is not, overall, a very pleasant thing to be. While some of the quick choose to make their best of their lot, or even thrive in Geb's undead-dominated society, you decided that whatever terrors the outside world holds, they pale in comparison to those that make up the Gebbite upper class. And considering that escape means braving the Mana Wastes, you must have been very, very certain indeed.",

When you {@action Hide} or {@action Sneak} successfully, you are also {@condition hidden} or {@condition concealed} from {@trait undead||undeads'} {@ability lifesense} and other special precise senses the {@trait undead} possess."
