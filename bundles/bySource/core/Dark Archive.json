In certain situations analogous to your past life, fragments of memories resurface, potentially helping or distracting you. The GM can offer you a +1 circumstance bonus on skill checks with either of these {@skill Lore} skills or on other skill checks that echo your past life. If you accept but fail the check, you're {@condition stupefied||stupefied 1} for 1 minute by the mental distraction of your past-life memories, or {@condition stupefied||stupefied 2} for 1 minute on a critical failure."
