					"You were the subject of a harrow reading at a pivotal point in your life, such as on an important birthday, or upon reaching adulthood. The reading was eerily accurate and has been relevant, for good or ill, at more points in your life than you could call mere coincidence.",
					"Randomly determine two harrow suits tied to your character, each reflecting a specific ability score. You can do so by drawing cards from a harrow deck or by rolling a {@dice d6}: 1 = hammers (Strength), 2 = keys (Dexterity), 3 = shields (Constitution), 4 = books (Intelligence), 5 = stars (Wisdom), 6 = crowns (Charisma). The first suit is your aligned score, and the second suit is your misaligned score.",

					"You're trained in your choice of the {@skill Occultism}, {@skill Performance}, or {@skill Society} skill and the {@skill Lore||Harrow Lore} skill. You gain the {@feat Dubious Knowledge} skill feat."
