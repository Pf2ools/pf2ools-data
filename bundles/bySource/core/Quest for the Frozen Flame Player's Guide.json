What you saw during the war changed you forever—so much so that you became a wanderer, hermit, or other voluntary outcast. When you came upon the Broken Tusk following, you determined you'd finally found a people whose values and traditions made you feel whole again. The Broken Tusk was supposedly once a much bigger following, and so you've joined them in the hopes of helping them heal old wounds and rebuild in the shadow of loss.

The role of songsinger is a great distinction. These chanters, musicians, and poets are responsible for recording, preserving, and sharing the Broken Tusk's oral history.
